# pipeline

Reusable (Composite) Github Actions for Bizzy CI/CD pipelines

File name should be action.yml or action.yaml

For details see [this info](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/creating-a-composite-action)

## Goal

The purpose of this action is to standardize the Bizzy CI/CD pipelines avoiding code duplication and enforcing these features:

* Include a branch protection rule to only allow merging of code to main via Pull Requests.
* Force the approval of each Pull Request by at least one user in the CODEOWNERS file.
* Automated update of CHANGELOG file based on the body of the Pull Request.
* Automatically create a Release with the next semver version based on Pull Requests tags.
* Scans reporitory to check if there are credentials stored as plain text.

## Repo Visibility

This repository is *public*. However, it doesn't contain any credentials or sensitive info.

If we set the repository to private, we'll need to checkout this repo on each client repo before using it. Also, the [post-run command will fail](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69034292/how-do-you-use-a-composite-action-that-exists-in-a-private-repository)

It's possible to set repositories as [Internal](https://dev.to/n3wt0n/finally-custom-github-actions-in-internal-repos-4l91) but this option is only available for Enterprise GitHub accounts.

## Client Repo Configuration

Add the following labels to the client repo (the repo that uses this action):

- release-major
- release-minor
- release-patch

These labels can be used to tag a Pull Request before merging it into main branch so we can choose how to increase the semantic version

## PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN repo

This action requires passing a variable named inputs.github-token

That token is the value of the organizational secret PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN, provided by each client pipeline using this composite action.

That secret was generated by creating a Personal Access Token for the `bizzy-robot` GitHub user. These are the scopes required:

- repo (so it's able to clone any repos like argocd repos)
- write:packages (so it can create a new GitHub release or even push a docker image to the GitHub registry)

Please set Expiration to Never.

NOTE: For details see [this documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-oauth-apps/scopes-for-oauth-apps)

## Usage

On a different repo create a file named (for example) `.github/workflows/pipeline.yaml`

```
name: deploy-production

on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main
    types:
      - closed

jobs:
  build:
    if: github.event.pull_request.merged == true
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # Bizzy CI/CD Action
      - name: Run CI/CD composite action
        uses: BizzyTeam/pipeline@main
        with:
          app-name: "backend"
          app-env: "production"
          docker-repository: "bizzy/backend"
          argocd-values-file: "charts/backend/values.yaml"

          github-token: ${{ secrets.PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
          docker-username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME }}
          docker-password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_HUB_PASSWORD }}
          argocd-repo-ssh-key: ${{ secrets.REPO_ARGO_TEST_SSHKEY }}
          slack-webhook-url: '' # No slack webhook created for prod yet
```

NOTE: If you use ECR, the docker-username and docker-password are your [IAM keys](https://github.com/docker/login-action#aws-elastic-container-registry-ecr)
